		<p>Reptile Control is a website that provides care guides for various species of lizards, 
		snakes, and turtles. These guides inform those who are planning or interested in owning reptiles <br>
		on how to best take care of them. These guides are also well suited for experienced 
		reptile pet owners who want to better understand their pets' needs. All guides contain factual <br>
		information from trusted sources in order to ensure your pet reptiles are handled safely.
		This website's intended goal is to provide users with the best methods and care for their reptiles <br>
		to ensure they live a healthy life.</p>
