		<h3>Rarely Make Noise</h3>
		<p>Pets such as dogs, cats, and even birds can get pretty noisy when you are home, but reptiles make very little
		to no noise which means they are very unlikely to disturb while you are focused on something else.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3>Low Maintenance</h3>
		<p>Obviously your pet reptiles still need to be cared for and given their necessities. However, they are generally
		easier to care for and require less attention compared to other pets.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3>No Worries for Damages</h3>
		<p>Since your reptiles will mostly be in their habitats, there is no worry for any potential damage for things such 
		as furniture, clothing, walls, and etc. Another plus is that reptiles don't have fur so you don't need to constantly
		clean areas your pets have made contact with.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3>No Training Required</h3>
		<p>Pets such as dogs often need to be trained in order to make them obedient and learn to be good pets. Reptiles however,
		have no need to learn much as they will stay in their enclosures. This means that they don't have to be sent to a 
		daycare or be professionally trained.</p>
